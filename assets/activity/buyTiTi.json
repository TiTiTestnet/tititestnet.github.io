Subsequently, the protocol will calculate how many rewards you'll earn according to your proportion against all users' transaction volume buying TiTi in the past 24 hrs. Moreover, the protocol will restart the rewards distribution calculation every 24 hrs. Remember, TiTi Use-to-earn farming rewards will be distributed to users in a 7-DAY-Cycle consecutively. Meanwhile, you are able to claim use-to-earn rewards of  the last Cycle (7 days) anytime after the Cycle finishes. The  unclaimed TiTi Rewards for past Cycles will be automatically accumulated to your address."
